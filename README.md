# Publish Dictionary Function

This is a CDK / AWS Lambda project for the publish dictionary function

The AWS Lambda function needs to be put behind an API Gateway with a custom domain `functions.lingdocs.com`.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

- `npm run build` compile typescript to js
- `npm run watch` watch for changes and compile
- `npm run test` perform the jest unit tests
- `npx cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `npx cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `npx cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
